# Basic Reason Template

Hello! This project allows you to quickly get started with Reason and BuckleScript. If you wanted a more sophisticated version, try the `react` template (`bsb -theme react -init .`).

# 1- Compile Reason to JavaScript
## Build
```
npm run build
```

## Build + Watch

```
npm run start
```


# 2- Run the compiled code with Node
> NodeJS >= 10.x is required
```
node src/Demo.bs.js
```
